# GamingStreams-tvOS-App

This is a cool app I built to learn more on tvOS. The goal is to offer an aggregation of streams from different networks like:

- twitch.tv
- youtube gaming
- hitbox.tv

I only support **Twitch** at the moment, features are :

- Browse by game and streamer
- Live chat with emoticons
- Change video quality

# Running the Project

###Things you need:
* XCode 7.1+
* Cocoapods 0.39+ (i.e. `sudo gem install cocoapods` or `sudo gem update cocoapods`)
* The XCodeColors plugin [available here](https://github.com/robbiehanson/XcodeColors). Otherwise the logging system will output color tags

### Installing Dependencies	
Since we're not including the /Pods directory in the git, you must run `pod install` inside the project directory to install dependencies

Make sure you open GamingStreamsTVApp.xcworkspace to include the generated Pods or you will run into compile errors.
