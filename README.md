# StreamCenter

StreamCenter is a tvOS project that aims at providing various video feeds to the AppleTV.

**NOTE:** Master is currently broken, please use develop until we get to a stable version.

# Running the Project

###Things you need:
* A version of XCode that supports tvOS
* A version of Cocoapods that supports tvos (i.e. `sudo gem install cocoapods -pre` )

### Installing Dependencies	
Since we're not including the /Pods directory in the git, you must run `pod install` inside the project directory to install dependencies

Make sure you open GamingStreamsTVApp.xcworkspace to include the generated Pods or you will run into compile errors.
